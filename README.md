# character-prediction

This repository represents my engineer's thesis at AGH University of Science and Technology.
My research paper is titled "Application for character prediction using machine learning" and it can be found in documents directory.

In my research I was developing a neural network in order to predict next character in a word.
Later I extended my application to work on sentence context so it was predicting a next word in a sentence.
In the end I compared neural networks to markov chain.
